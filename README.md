# JavaDataStructuresDemo
This is an App that demonstrates data structures that are used in programming. It also has a Server that will relay messages on a network. The CDR Archive app will send messages to the "Robot arm" which will would organize or manage the physical storage of an archive of CD's. 

Download both files in the repo.
Run the Arm Project first, because this contains the Server the two programs use to communicate. 
Run the Archive Project Second, to connect to the server. 

This Projects scenario is to develop a desktop application using java that will manage CD repository. We can add, remove, and alter the loan status of each CD. these will send messages to a robotic arm that managed a physical repository of CD's this process. 

The App will send a message through the connected port to the server then onto the arm where you will need to simulate the response from the robot by pressing the process button to confirm a successful command.

The Arm will then send a message back to the Archive who will update the data storage. 

This Application has a few unnecessary implementations of data structures and concepts that are there to demonstrate the ability to use them. they include. 
  - hash maps
  - Binary trees
  - in, pre, post order traversals	
  - Doubly linked lists.
  - merge sort, bubble sort, heapsort algorithms 
  - Filtering, searching Data tables.
